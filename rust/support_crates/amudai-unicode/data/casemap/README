The files were generated from `core::unicode::conversions::UPPERCASE_TABLE` and
`core::unicode::conversions::LOWERCASE_TABLE` respectively by taking
only regular conversion cases into account (a single char is converted to a single char).

Support for 'ß' (223) and 'ẞ' (7838) is added manually (the case conversion
is defined by the new standard since 2017).
