//! This module defines the core abstraction for sequences of values used in the
//! Amudai data system.
//!
//! It provides the [`Sequence`] trait, representing an abstract sequence of values,
//! and re-exports [`ValueSequence`] for concrete implementations. Sequences serve as
//! the primary interface for working with columnar data in Amudai shards, supporting
//! dynamic type inspection and efficient access to element counts, types, and values.
